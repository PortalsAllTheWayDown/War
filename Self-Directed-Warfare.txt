War or any kind of conflict is waged and won through strategy.
Think of strategy as a series of lines and arrows aimed at a goal: at getting you to a certain point in the world, at helping you to attack a problem in your path, at figuring out how to encircle and destroy your enemy.
Before directing these arrows at your enemies, however, you must first direct them at yourself.

Your mind is the starting point of all war and all strategy. A mind that is easily overwhelmed by emotion, that is rooted in the past instead of the present, that cannot see the world with clarity and urgency, will create strategies that will always miss the mark.

To become a true strategist, you must take three steps. First, become aware of the weakness and illness that can take hold of the mind, warping its strategic powers, Second declare a kind of war on yourself to make yourself move forward. Third, wage ruthless and continual battle on the enemies with you by applying certain strategies.

Without an enemy you can be lost, duped by other peoples treachery, you hesitate at the fatal moment and descend into whining and argument.
Focus on an enemy. It can be someone who blocks your path or sabotages you, it can be a value or an idea that you loathe and that you see in an individual or a group.
It can be an abstaction: stupidity, smugness, vulgar materialism.

Do not listen to the people that say that the distinction between friend and enemy is primitive and passe.
They are trying to push you off course and infect you with the vagueness that inflicts them.
Once you feel clear and motivated, you will have space for true friendship and true compromise.
Your enemy is the polar star that guides you. Given that direction, you can enter battle.
