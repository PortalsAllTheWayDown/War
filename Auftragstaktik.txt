Auftragstaktik(mission-oriented command system)
In German there are two words for "command":Auftrag and Befehl.
A Befehl is an order to be obeyed to the letter. An Auftrag is much more general: it is a statement of overall mission, a directive to be followed in its spirit, not its letter.
German Warfare: Speed, the need to take the offensive and so on.
To develop this officers are trained to think on their own.

The german officers were judged by the results of their actions not on how those results were achieved.
Not having a rigid setup, and having blitzkrieg warfare they took france and other countries with amazing speed.

The key to the Auftragstaktik is an overall group philosophy. This can be built around the cause you are fighting for or a belief in the evil of the enemy you face.

Find exercises to increase your troops knowledge of and trust in each other.
This will develop implicit communication skills between them and their intuitive sense of what to do next.

The union had alot of pioneers, rugged frontiersmen and they were fiercely independent. This caused alot of issues as generals were trying to instill discipline and mostly they failed.
But General William Tecumseh Sherman had a different solution. He created a more democratic army, encouraged initiative in his offices, let them dress as they saw fit;
he loosened outward discipline to foster morale and group spirit.
Like frontiersmen generally, his soldiers were restless and nomadic, so he exploited their mobility and kept his army in perpetual motion, always marching faster than his enemies could.
Of all the Union armies, Sheman's were the most feared and performed the  best.
Be creative with the groups structure, keeping your mind as fluid and adaptable as the army you lead.
